DOI: https://doi.org/10.1088/2399-6528/ab0aa9

Python library for retrodiction and coarse-graining in quantum state tomography, which include modified techniques such as Bayesian inference and Projected Gradient Descent with Backtracking. Further details on the motivation and theory (including pseudocode) can be found in our manuscript.
